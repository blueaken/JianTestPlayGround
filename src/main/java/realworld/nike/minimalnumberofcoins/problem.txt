Minimal Number of Coins for Change

Problem: Please implement a function which gets the minimal number of coins, whose value
is v1, v2, â€¦, vn, to make change for an amount of money with value t. Any coin with value
 vi may duplicate for any times to make change.

For example, the minimal number of coins to make change for 15 out of a set of coins with
value 1, 3, 9, 10 is 3. We can choose two coins with value 3 and a coin with value 9. The
 number of coins for other choices should be greater than 3.

Solution:
A advanced DP problem: minCoins[s] = Math.min(minCoins[s], minCoins[s - coin] + 1)
