m x n 2d array with 2 apis, it is running under the infinite incoming data steam env (what does this mean? it is
the key to this question)

void update(int x, int y, int value) - upsert the value on position x : y;
int query(int x1, int y1, int x2, int y2) - return the subrectangle area from x1 : y1 to x2 : y2.

under the following 3 conditions the best solution:
1. update frequent
a: this is just normal 2d array, since each update call can be done in constant time.

2. query frequent
a: my answer is to maintain a sum hash map in update operation (sum from 0 : 0 to x : y), note may need to update
the other fields of the sum map. Then the query operation can be done in constant time: big rectangle minus small
rectangle (4 rectangles in the formula)

3. both frequent
