note the order of map.put(numbers[i], i) has to be after comparison otherwise the newly add row can affect the result
test case: {1,0,-1} 0.

in case, interviewee ask a solution without hash map, can sort the input array then find the target step by step.
Time is O(nlogn + n) = O(nlogn) (sort + search). Note the result is value instead of index.

Both is better than the brute force O(n^2)
