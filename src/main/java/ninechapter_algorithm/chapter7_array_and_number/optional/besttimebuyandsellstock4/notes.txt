Solution 1 -
follow Tushar Roy's 1st part of video, it works fine but out of memory since it is O(kN^2)

follow the 2nd part of the video and get the solution works on unit tests, but still out of memory, even the
 time has been improved to O(nk). Will leave it alone for now consider it very unlikely to hit this in real
 interview in Shanghai.
