bruce solution can solve it in O(m+n), but the goal is to find O(log m+n) solution.

The problem is similar to find topK elements - with a algorithm called "quick select". When k = (m+n)/2, then the
median is found.

the case of equal size is well explained below -
Ref : IDeserve -  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHNTl_NvOj0
and the code of different size can be found：

（the solution above is slightly diff than kth smallest）

看了阿里社招的文章，没有心情深究KTH ELEMENT SOLUTION，直接抄答案了。下次还是应该自己做一遍。
