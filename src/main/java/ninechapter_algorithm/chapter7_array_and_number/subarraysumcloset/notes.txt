I got the idea of this problem is to put the sum of each position into an array and then sort it and found the least
diff and then return the index back. I tried but there are still 2 questions:

1. why the sum array need be sorted?
2. the result on idea is different then the lintcode OJ.

I read the online posts and nine chapter answers, but still got the same result. Will leave it alone and move forward
for now.
