Ref clean book P:99, note the OJ of lint code cannot catch this bug:

For case where AL == AM == AR, the minimum could be on AMâ€™s left or right side (eg,
[1, 1, 1, 0, 1] or [1, 0, 1, 1, 1]). In this case, we could not discard either subarrays and
therefore such worst case degenerates to the order of O(n).

But we can start++ / end-- to narrow the range, correct?

Or just apply linear search on this as the nine chapter answer
