I figured it out with LinkedHashMap since it has O(1) read/write performance and also keep the order of creating as
LRU cache needs;

The nine chapter and code ganker use the relative complex solution with a HashMap and a double direction node, which
also achieve O(1) read/write performance. And a dummy head and dummy tail to maintain the double linked list.  Don't
understand why these guys didn't figure it out the LinkedHashMap solution, but I will practice this solution for the
practice purpose.
