ref both nine chapter class notes on rectangle
and CG's post - http://blog.csdn.net/linhuanmars/article/details/24444491

I like CG's solution on calculate each row's height and it has a small DP on it. After each row's height array is
figured out then it the pretty much the same as get largest rectangle in histogram. Good if you solve it first.

The time is O(mn) - the best possible, which is brilliant.
