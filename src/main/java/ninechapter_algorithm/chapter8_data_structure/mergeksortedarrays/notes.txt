since int[] cannot fit in PriorityQueue create a customer type Element instead, as far as the row and col info is
stored with the Element class then the rest is easy.

it is similar to merge k sorted lists and if Priority Queue is not allowed by the interviewee then we can divide
and conquer
- from top to end
- 2 and 2 pairs

这道题用array做有些别扭，没有用list那么酣畅淋漓 ：）
