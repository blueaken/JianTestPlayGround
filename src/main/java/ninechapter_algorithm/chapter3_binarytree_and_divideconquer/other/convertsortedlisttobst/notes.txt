a naive way to follow the sorted array and traverse half the list on each level and the time complexity is O(nlogn)
- the extra penalty from each level need access n/2 of the list and there are logN such level.

there exists a neat solution of bottom up and which is actually an inorder traverse, thinking the result of inorder
traverse on a BST is a sorted list.
