bfs or dfs?
both works but use bfs on graph if possible.
dfs uses recursive for each node and in graph the recursive level will be very big. this is unlike the tree situation
 where the recursive is for each level.

bfs in graph needs the help of HashMap in additional of Queue, which is the only data structure in tree bfs. HashMap
stores the visited info to avoid infinite loop

i use 3 steps for clean logic, can use 2 steps while more practised. Time is the same － O（n）
