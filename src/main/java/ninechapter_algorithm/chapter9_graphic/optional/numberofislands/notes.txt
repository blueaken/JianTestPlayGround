try both dfs and bfs and both ACed!
- dfs, I like the relative straightforward to code. But space efficiency is much worse than bfs, especially in the
case of graph.

- bfs, the reason it need not Visited set is because each visited node is marked as new value and there is no need
to reset for other start nodes as "word search"
