dfs - the diff is there are multiple start points at each step, find it and dfs on each one.

self made it, lots of details to look at:
1. Set contains for customer class
2. backtrack add/remove new chars has to be paired

finally I believe the algorithm is correct but got TLE on 95%

I like the nine chapter solution though - redo it
妙！用reset current position的办法来代替visited Set并且防止traverse back，当然如果当前尝试fail了还是要复位的。
AC了。
