this is really embarrassment - at first I think reverse the whole list and compare it will work but if the list is
reversed then the original order is lost unless we copy the original but it will not be space O(1).

There are 2 ways to solve it:
1. find the middle point and reverse the part after middle node. Compare if it is the same from the first half.

2. Not need to reverse but when finding the middle point, use stack to copy the front half's values and compare it
with the 2nd half. Note this method the find mid point method need to return the node after mid point.
