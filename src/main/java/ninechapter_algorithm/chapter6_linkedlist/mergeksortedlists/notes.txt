- use both PriorityQueue and Divide and Conquer

- PriorityQueue is sick to null so has to do null check

- each PriorityQueue operation cost is O(logk), total is O(nlogk), n is total nodes

- interviewee may ask to implement without PriorityQueue, so it is important to know the DC solution

- DC solution is still O(nlogk) - T(N) = O(N) + T(N/2)

- the DC loop structure ref clean book

NINE CHAPTER用递归来解决D&C，可以看一下，还有两两归并的方法。
