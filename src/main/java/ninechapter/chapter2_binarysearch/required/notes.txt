Before class:
1. review and understand totally the binary formula from clean book
   and find one mistake on P:96 - when the loop ends, the start can be
   greater than end

 while (start < end){
  ...
 }
 return nums[start] == target ? start : -1;


2. do the required exercises and study the pattern from the nine chapter answers:
 while (start + 1 < end){
  ...
 }

 if (nums[start] == target) ...
 if (nums[end] == target) ...
 return -1;
