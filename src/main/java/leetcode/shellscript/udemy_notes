Wildcards:
exe 1: For "extra credit" make sure gracefully handle instances where there are no ".jpg" files in the
       current directory. (Hint: Man bash and read the section on the nullglob option.)

SJ: research it and figure out can use "shopt -s nullglob" and "shopt -u nullglob" to start / shut down
nullglob option. "shopt" alone shows the current shell script options.

Test it with "echo *.jpg *.txt" and when nullglob is off, it shows all the jpg file names and "*.txt" as text.
When nullglob is on it only shows jpg file names. The nullglob will treat wildcards pattern text as null if there
is no match.

Then I think it is why shell script does not set nullglob as true by default, since it is not ideal in a number of
cases, for example: "ls *.txt", when nullglob is on the "*.txt" is treat as null string, then it will show all the
files and directories under current folder, which is not ideal.

Logging:
- facility feels like (SJ: not sure) just a text in system.log file, not a new log file. To create application's
own log file, simply use echo "message" >customer log file name

- to use "logger" command has advantage of some built-in features like add pid with -i, etc.

While Loop:
- /dev/null is a black hole where any data sent, will be discarded
- 2 is the file descriptor for Standard Error
  > is for redirect
  & is the symbol for file descriptor (without it, the following 1 would be considered a filename)
  1 is the file descriptor for Standard Out

  Therefore >/dev/null 2>&1 is redirect the output of your program to /dev/null. Include both the Standard Error
  and Standard Out.

Debugging:
-x: very good debug option added after shbang bash. It displays commands as they will execute, including all
expansions and substitutions.

-e: script stop on first failed command.

- to make vi syntax highlight is cool

Scripts used to create this course:
- Jason shares his script to create audio files and the ones to convert pdf files intp png files
- interesting and looke shell script is very powerful in many places to automate the work
- can use it as part of template
