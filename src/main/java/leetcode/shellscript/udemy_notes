Wildcards:
exe 1: For "extra credit" make sure gracefully handle instances where there are no ".jpg" files in the
       current directory. (Hint: Man bash and read the section on the nullglob option.)

SJ: research it and figure out can use "shopt -s nullglob" and "shopt -u nullglob" to start / shut down
nullglob option. "shopt" alone shows the current shell script options.

Test it with "echo *.jpg *.txt" and when nullglob is off, it shows all the jpg file names and "*.txt" as text.
When nullglob is on it only shows jpg file names. The nullglob will treat wildcards pattern text as null if there
is no match.

Then I think it is why shell script does not set nullglob as true by default, since it is not ideal in a number of
cases, for example: "ls *.txt", when nullglob is on the "*.txt" is treat as null string, then it will show all the
files and directories under current folder, which is not ideal.
