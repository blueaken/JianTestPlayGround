real interview question from Morgan Stanley:

# Write a routine to read a text file and count up
# the number of times that each word occurs in the file
# (case insensitive is okay).  Then return a list of words,
# sorted by frequency of occurrence.

looks easy but to write an elegant solution not easy.
