In order solution is interesting, like it since it keeps the basic idea to solve tree problem. Keep the prev node before
processing right sub tree is the meat.

Pre order solution also interesting, to setup boundry on the rec is the meat.

The meat of the Brute Force solution is to know the worst case is O(n^2) when the tree degenerate itself to
a linked list.
