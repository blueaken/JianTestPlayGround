1. other than brute force, use hash map can solve it in O(n), with O(n) space. It needs 2 map, one for label and another
for new instance. Here comes Solution.java, and AC the 1st time!

2. think it twice, another way to optimize is to use 1 hash map. Solution_OneMap.java

3. another way to solve it is to process on the original space, make a copy and then link. Then delink. Loop 3 times.
