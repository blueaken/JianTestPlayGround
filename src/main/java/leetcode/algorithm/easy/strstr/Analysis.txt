Clean book analysis:

The brute force method is straightforward to implement. We scan the needle with the haystack from its first position and start matching all subsequent letters one by one. If one of the letters does not match, we start over again with the next position in the haystack.
Assume that n = length of haystack and m = length of needle, then the runtime complexity is O(nm).
Have you considered these scenarios?

1. needle or haystack is empty. If needle is empty, always return 0. If haystack is empty, then there will always be no match (return –1) unless needle is also empty which 0 is returned.
2. needle’s length is greater than haystack’s length. Should always return –1.
3. needle is located at the end of haystack. For example, “aaaba” and “ba”. Catch possible off-by-one errors.
4. needle occur multiple times in haystack. For example, “mississippi” and
“issi”. It should return index 2 as the first match of “issi”.
5. Imagine two very long strings of equal lengths = n, haystack = “aaa...aa” and needle = “aaa...ab”. You should not do more than n character comparisons, or else your code will get Time Limit Exceeded in OJ.

Below is a clean implementation – no special if statements for all the above scenarios.
