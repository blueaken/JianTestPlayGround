Recursive way is straightforward, but with the caution of root itself does not count as leaf node.

Level order traversal is more interesting, also called with a term BFS - breadth first search, with a queue.
BFS improved the search by avoiding traveling the whole tree when it is unbalanced. Met similar problem in EMC interview.
